# Leo Lie McGrath

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am Leo Lie McGrath, a passionate computer science student at NTNU. This page highlights my journey, projects, and skills in the world of technology.

## About Me

As a Computer Technology student at NTNU, Class of '28, I've nurtured a fascination with programming that began at the age of 10. My journey started in the video game "Minecraft", where I programmed robots to bypass the game's more mundane tasks. This early exposure to problem-solving through code ignited a lasting love for technology and its potential.

Currently, I serve the student community as an active member of Abakus, my line union. Here, I have learned leadership and team skills. I am eager to shape a future where my passion for programming translates into positive change.
